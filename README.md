# Arduino Labs

This repository contains my Arduino projects, experiments, and hardware prototypes.
The goal is to build a solid understanding of embedded systems through hands-on work,
from basic circuits to more complex sensor and actuator integrations.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder represents a standalone project and includes:
- source code (`.ino`)
- wiring diagrams or notes (when relevant)
- short explanation of the idea and behavior
