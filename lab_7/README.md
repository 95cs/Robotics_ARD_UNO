Analog Keyboard Instrument (Lab 7)
This project highlights clean, modular code and efficient hardware resource utilization.

Description

A musical keyboard instrument that uses a resistor ladder to read multiple buttons through a single analog pin. Each button triggers a specific musical note and a corresponding visual indicator.


Technical Features

Modular Array Management: LED pins (2, 3, 4, and 5) are managed within an array (piniLed[]) to allow for centralized iteration and control.

Custom Functions: Implementation of the aprindeLed(int index) function to reduce code duplication and handle LED states abstractly.

Analog Signal Processing: Interprets discrete voltage values from a single analog pin to differentiate between four different button presses.

Audio-Visual Feedback: Synchronizes musical tones (DO, RE, MI, FA) generated by the buzzer on pin 8 with the activation of the correct LED.
